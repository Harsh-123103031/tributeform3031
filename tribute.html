      <p>Following are few points telling his life story in short: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>EARLY LIFE AND AND FAMILY:</strong>
         Sam Manekshaw was born on 3 April 1914 in Amritsar, Punjab, to Hormizd.Manekshaw (1871–1964), who was a doctor, and Hilla, née Mehta (1885–1970).Both of his parents were Parsis who had moved to Amritsar from the city of Valsad in coastal Gujarat.Manekshaw's parents had left Mumbai in 1903 for Lahore, where his father was going to start practising medicine. However, when their train halted at Amritsar station, Hilla found it impossible to travel any further due to her advanced pregnancy.After Hilla had recovered from giving birth, the couple decided to stay in Amritsar, where Hormizd soon set up a clinic and pharmacy. The couple had four sons (Fali, Jan, Sam and Jami) and two daughters (Cilla and Sheru). Manekshaw was their fifth child and third son.<br>  During World War II, Hormizd had served in the British Indian Army as a captain in the Indian Medical Service (now the Army Medical Corps).Manekshaw's elder brothers Fali and Jan became engineers, while his sisters Cilla and Sheru became teachers. Manekshaw's younger brother Jami became a doctor and served in the Royal Indian Air Force as a medical officer. In 1948, Jami became the first Indian to be awarded air surgeon's wings from Naval Air Station Pensacola in the United States, after completing a training course there. Jami joined his elder brother, Sam, in becoming a flag officer, and retired as an air vice marshal in the Indian Air Force.
      </li>
        <li><strong>EDUCATION:</strong>Manekshaw completed his primary schooling in Punjab, and then joined Sherwood College, Nainital. In 1929, he graduated from the college at the age of 15 with his junior high school certificate.In 1931, he passed his senior high school examinations with distinction. Manekshaw then asked his father to send him to London to study medicine, but his father refused as he was not old enough. His father was already supporting Sam's elder brothers who were studying engineering in London.Manekshaw instead enrolled at the Hindu Sabha College (now the Hindu College, Amritsar). In April 1932, Manekshaw sat for the final exams held by the University of the Punjab, passing with a third division (equivalent to a C) in science
         <br>A formal notification for the entrance examination to enrol in the newly established Indian Military Academy (IMA) was issued in the early months of 1932. Examinations were scheduled for June or July.[15] In an act of rebellion against his father's refusal to send him to London, Manekshaw applied for a place and sat for the entrance exams in Delhi. On 1 October 1932, he was one of the fifteen cadets to be selected through an open competition,[c] and placed sixth in the order of merit.
          </li>  
        <li><strong>MILLITARY CARRIER:</strong>When Manekshaw was commissioned, it was standard practice for newly commissioned Indian officers to be initially assigned to a British regiment before being sent to an Indian unit. Manekshaw thus joined the 2nd Battalion, Royal Scots, stationed at Lahore. He was later posted to the 4th Battalion, 12th Frontier Force Regiment (4/12 FF), stationed in Burma.[22][23][24] On 1 May 1938, he was appointed quartermaster of his company.[25] Already fluent in Punjabi, Hindi, Urdu, English and his native Gujarati, in October 1938 Manekshaw qualified as a Higher Standard army interpreter in Pashto
          <br>After the war, Gandhi decided to promote Manekshaw to the rank of field marshal and appoint him as the chief of defence staff (CDS). However, after several objections from the commanders of the navy and the air force, the appointment was dropped. Because Manekshaw was from the army, there were concerns that the comparatively smaller forces of the navy and air force would be neglected. Moreover, the bureaucrats felt that the appointment might reduce their influence over defence issues.Though Manekshaw was to retire in June 1972, his term was extended by a period of six months, and "in recognition of outstanding services to the Armed Forces and the nation," he was promoted to the rank of field marshal on 1 January 1973.The first Indian Army officer to be so promoted, he was formally conferred with the rank in a ceremony held at the Rashtrapati Bhavan (President's Residence) on 3 January

        <li><strong>PERSONAL LIFE AND DEATH:</strong>Manekshaw married Silloo Bode on 22 April 1939 in Bombay. The couple had two daughters, Sherry and Maya (later Maja), born in 1940 and 1945 respectively. Manekshaw died of complications from pneumonia at the Military Hospital in Wellington, Tamil Nadu, at 12:30 a.m. on 27 June 2008 at the age of 94.Reportedly, his last words were "I'm okay!.He was buried at the Parsi cemetery in Udhagamandalam (Ooty), Tamil Nadu, with military honours, adjacent to his wife's grave.His funeral lacked governmental representation, which the media argued was a result of the civilian establishment's apathy towards the military, who feared that the military would stage a coup if it became too popular with the citizenry.A national day of mourning was not declared. While this was not a breach of protocol, such commemoration is customary for a leader of national importance.Bangladesh, however, did pay tribute to Manekshaw on his death.He was survived by two daughters and three grandchildren.
          <br>Manekshaw was charismatic and known to be capable of charm. He was often described as a gentleman.Like others of his generation, his background in the British army gave him a fondness for some English habits, such as drinking whiskey and wearing his handlebar moustache.His background as a Parsi is sometimes attributed as a factor in his ambition and success.He commanded great loyalty from his troops, particularly the Gorkhas, due to his reputation for personal bravery, fairness and his avoidance of punishments.He came into conflict with politicians, however, because he stood up to their often unreasonable or unethical demands. They also disliked his popularity as they feared the possibility of a military coup. He dealt with politicians' demands through sarcasm, which however was recognised by figures such as Indira Gandhi.
</li>
        <li><strong>LEGACY:</strong>Vijay Diwas (lit. Victory Day) is celebrated on 16 December every year in honor of the victory achieved under Manekshaw's leadership in 1971. On 16 December 2008, a postage stamp depicting Manekshaw in his field marshal's uniform was released by then President Pratibha Patil.
